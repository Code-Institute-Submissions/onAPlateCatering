## UX

This website was created by following The Five Planes of User Experience. The planes are strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface. I first put myself in the shoes of the business owner and potential customer and listed all the needs I could think of, no matter how abstract. I then wrote down all the features and functions that would be necessary to meet the needs and reduced this list based on what was possible given the time constraint and level of coding knowledge.
With a reduced list of features expected to meet the user's needs, I then worked out what elements would be required to create these functions. With a more concrete idea in mind, I explored how a user would navigate to successfully meet their needs. With several prototypes drawn by hand, I decided to create a wireframe using Balsamiq to look at the outline on different devices. With this template, I started coding for mobile users and then altered the code for other devices to improve usability.

## Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes for this project were created using Balsamiq and can be viewed at below link.

Link to [Wireframe](/assets/wireframes/onAPlateCateringWireframes.pdf)

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the website was created using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/gradient-palette/) . I choose to use a gradient palette of 5 colours going from a medium light shade of cyan to dark blue. The colour gradient palette is shown below with the hex colours.
The medium light shade of cyan was used to create a conservative colour palette, combining with darker shades of blue and green. I wanted to avoid using colours that are associated with fast food marketing such as red, orange and yellow shades.

### Typography

I wanted the text to appear elegant without sacrificing readability. I browsed google fonts and selected "Cormorant Garamond" and "Roboto".
These fonts are used across the website. "Sans-serif" was used as a replacement font if "Cormorant Garamond" or "Roboto" was not available.

### Images

Images used on this website are aimed at the target audience to engage with us. Using images that look elegant while also linking up with On A Plate Catering's offering.
I believe the website achieves this without overloading images that could affect performance.

## Testing

### Code Validation

Html pages were validated with [W3C Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu) . Several errors were discovered that have since been fixed. The errors were:

- Error 1
  - Element button must not appear as a descendant of the a element.
    - This error was fixed by reviewing the Bootstrap documentation and putting the button class on the a element to give the same output as before.
- Error 2
  - iframe element gave error that attributes are obsolete and to use CSS instead. These attributes were margin height, margin width and frameboard scrolling.
    - I removed these attributes from the html code and put styling for the iframe in style.css instead.
- Error 3
  - The value of the for attribute of the label element must be the ID of a non-hidden form control.
    - I had forgotten the ID attribute for this form element. I added the ID for the relevant form element.

CSS pages were validated with [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) . 2 errors were discovered.

- Error 1
  - property overscroll-behaviour doesn't exist.
    - I looked online and verified that the property does exist according to [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overscroll-behavior).
- Error 2
  - value error: font-weight 1000 is not a font-weight value.
    - I had previously looked up the maximum for this value and misinterpreted the answer to mean it was 1000. I changed this to 900 the maximum.

After fixing the errors I re-ran all HTML and CSS files through the validators and only error present is the overscroll-behaviour error that can be ignored.

### Performance Testing

Performance was tested using Lighthouse, one of google web developers tools.

#### Home Page

The first time I ran the audit on the home page, the performance was low as per image below.

![](assets/images/homepage-performance-1.png)

The results were not unexpected as I had noticed that the page took several seconds to load. The outputs of the audit highlighted that the website image files were too large and causing performance issues.
I used [Pic Resize](https://picresize.com/) to reduce the image size without sacrificing quality. I then reran the report. I was happy the performance improved greatly across all pages and I could see this after reloading the page.

![](assets/images/homepage-performance-2.png)

#### Menu Page

![](assets/images/menu-performance.png)

#### Quote Page

![](assets/images/quote-performance.png)

#### Contact Page

![](assets/images/contact-performance.png)

The performance was slower on this page as the map is an iframe and is known to be slower because there is an additional overhead for the browser. A future improvement would be to use JavaScript to replace the iframe.

According to Lighthouse using the a element with links to another page can pose security and performance risks. To improve my website I followed their advice and added the rel="noopener" property to all of the target="\_blank" links. This improved the best practices score across all pages from 86 to 93.

### User Stories Testing

From the user stories listed earlier the objectives of On a Plate Catering currently intends to meet can be summarised as:

- I would like to be able to view a menu of food.
- I would like to be able to request a quote.
- I would like to see reviews from other customers who used service.
- I would like to contact the company for more queries.
- I want to increase my brand awareness and social following.

From Testing, the aims are met as follows:

- I would like to be able to view a menu of food.
  - The navigation bar clearly shows the user where the menu is.
  - A call to action is shown on the home page with a button in the 'what we offer' section leading the person to the menu.
- I would like to be able to request a quote.
  - A call to action button is present on the landing page and is the first thing a user sees.
  - On the menu page another call to action button is present guiding the user to the quote page.
  - The request a quote option is in the navigation bar.
- I would like to see reviews from other customers who used service.
  - Testimonials are present on the landing page and are styled to grab the reader's attention.
- I would like to contact the company for more queries.
  - Contact section is shown in the navigation bar.
- I want to increase my brand awareness and social following.
  - The footer on all pages has links to the social pages as is standard practice for websites and the user would know to navigate to this.

### Functionality Testing

I tested the functionality of the site on a laptop first.

- I clicked on each menu option in the navigation bar and the desired page loaded as expected.
- I confirmed that the current page is underlined in the navigation bar for each page.
- I checked that the company logo on each page links back to the home page.
- I clicked on the 2 buttons on the home page and the correct pages were navigated to.
- I clicked the button on the menu page and the correct page loaded.
- I click on the social icons in the footer on each page and verified that the desired social website opens in a new page.
- On the contact page, I checked that the embedded map zoom function works and that when you click view larger map, it opens in a new page on google maps.
- On the get a quote page, I checked each input to ensure I could enter data and for the drop down list that it works as expected. I pressed the submit button to check it acts as expected. When I build on my coding skills I will have a message appearing once submit button is used.

The testing was then conducted on a mobile and the above steps were repeated including testing the toggle of the menu, toggle open and close worked on all pages as expected.

### Validation Testing

The get a quote form was tested for validation.

- I tested each input by leaving one blank at a time and checking the correct validation message is given. This worked for all cells except the drop down input.
  - I then updated the code with required property for this field and re-tested all the cells. The name, email, phone number and catering occasion fields acted as expected and are required to. The additional text field is not a required field.

### Compatibility Testing

#### Different devices

Using Google Developer tools, I viewed the website on the following devices:

- Galaxy S5
- Pixel 2
- Pixel 2 XL
- iPhone 5/6/7/8 & Plus
- iPhone X
- iPad & iPad Pro
- Surface duo
- Galaxy fold

Based on the results I decided to alter media query in styles.css to only change from mobile design to laptop for screen width of greater than 770px as the surface Duo and iPad had sections that looked squashed.

#### Different Browsers

I tested the website on:

- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Internet explorer

Differences discovered across browsers:

- The contact page form placeholder text inside fields is not centered on safari as styled. On Chrome, Firefox, Edge the placeholder text is centered.
- The property overscroll-behaviour is not compatible with safari or Internet explorer. This was expected as documented by [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overscroll-behavior).
- If using autofill, a form field changes the colour of the cell. The cell colour varies depending on the browser.
- Internet explorer does not support the property Justify-content: space evenly. This was checked on [Can I us](https://caniuse.com/?search=justify-content). All other browsers tested do.
  - I fixed this using a media query for IE as per the suggestion on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28417056/how-to-target-only-ie-any-version-within-a-stylesheet) by setting flex grow as per suggestion on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47534216/how-to-make-css-justify-contentspace-evenly-fallback-to-space-between-on-safari).

The before and after images are shown below on Internet Explorer using [Lamba Test](https://app.lambdatest.com/) .
